# MonadoxML
This is a machine learning training and inference pipeline for mental state classification using EEG signal data. This project processes raw EEG data, extracts relevant features, and applies classification models to analyze cognitive and emotional states.  

The pipeline is modular and can be extended with additional signal processing techniques, EEG feature extraction methods and ML/DL models.


## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or newer
- Conda

### Code installation
Clone the repository, create a conda environment and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xiaocheny1209/MonadoxML.git
cd MonadoxML
conda create -n env_name python=3.10
conda activate env_name
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset Instructions
Before running the code, you need to download the dataset manually and place it in the appropriate directory. Below are the steps to follow:

### 1. Download the Dataset

- Download **Data.zip** from FACED Dataset: [Download link for FACED dataset](<https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn50614194/files/>)


### 2. Folder Structure

Once you have downloaded the dataset, unzip it, rename it as "FACED" and put it under the **data/** folder.


## Usage
Run the pipeline
```bash
python src/main.py
```
